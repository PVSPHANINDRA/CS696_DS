  The dataset is available in Hugging Face and for more details - [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/clinc_oos)

  Dataset contains 150 intent classes over 10 domains + one intent class labeled oos(out of scope). And it comes in different subsets:

  - small: Small, in which there are only 50 training queries per each in-scope intent
  - imbalanced: Imbalanced, in which intents have either 25, 50, 75, or 100 training queries.
  - plus: OOS+, in which there are 250 out-of-scope training examples, rather than 100.
